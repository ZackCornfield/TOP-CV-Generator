## Technologies Used
1. **React**:
   - Component-based architecture for modular and reusable UI elements.
   - Efficient state management using `useState` and event handling.
   - Dynamic rendering and form handling.

2. **JavaScript (ES6)**:
   - Array methods (`slice`, `spread operator`, etc.) for manipulating data.
   - Event-driven programming for form submission handling.

3. **CSS**:
   - Custom styling for a polished and professional user interface.
   - Media queries for responsiveness.

## Skills Applied
1. **State Management**:
   - Updated and managed user inputs dynamically using React's state hooks.

2. **Form Handling**:
   - Captured and processed user inputs via controlled form components.

3. **Array Manipulation**:
   - Utilized JavaScript array methods to update specific entries in the state.

4. **Event Handling**:
   - Leveraged `event.preventDefault()` to override default form behaviors and ensure proper submission logic.

5. **Responsive Design**:
   - Implemented CSS techniques to make the application adaptable to different screen sizes.

6. **Version Control**:
   - Used Git for tracking changes and managing the development process.

7. **Problem-Solving**:
   - Tackled challenges like efficiently updating nested state objects and ensuring UI reflects changes instantly.
